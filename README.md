# poutine-action

This is a simple GitHub Action to simplify using poutine as part of GitHub Actions workflows.

Created by BoostSecurity.io, poutine is a security scanner that detects misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in the build pipelines of a repository. It supports parsing CI workflows from GitHub Actions and Gitlab CI/CD. When given an access token with read-level access, poutine can analyze all the repositories of an organization to quickly gain insights into the security posture of the organization's software supply chain.
